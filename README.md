Homework 4 Game

I chose the recommended "Crystal Collector" assignment.
Users are given a random number at the start of the game.

Clicking on a Simpsons Character will add a specific amount of points to the total score. Users don't know what value each charater has until they click it. Then they have to remember each number and add them up to match the random number.

It's not a particularly 'useful' game, but it's fun. It challenges your memory and your math skills.
